            <p class="content">
                A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, 
                seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. The year 1886 is 
                regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. 
                Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, 
                an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn 
                carriages and carts. In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, 
                additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. 
                These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. 
                Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of 
                fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available 
                in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025. The transition from fossil 
                fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 
                100 actionable solutions for climate change.

            <p class="content">
                There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, 
                interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, 
                parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road 
                congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. 
                Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.
                 Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, 
                 transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation 
                 from taxes. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies. 
                 There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide. Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, 
                 and other newly industrialized countries.
